# Efficiency Demo

This demo is based two demo videos ([reactive scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qScTsLGyOi8) and [proactive scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epgcMXS55tQ)) and sets up a project that:
* creates an Efficiency SLO mapping
* generates an Efficiency SLO Controller
* generates a custom horizontal elasticity strategy
* generates an SLO Mapping instance and deploys it
* generates a Grafana dashboard
* creates a predicted metric controller

You can find details and the commands we execute in the demos under the `docs` folder:
* [Reactive scaling](./docs/Reactive-Demo.md)
* [Proactive scaling](./docs/Proactive-Demo.md)
