# Universal Recommender Example Use Case

This document describes an example use case for leveraging Polaris to enforce an SLO on a recommender system.
Specifically, we have chosen [Universal Recommender](https://actionml.com/docs/h_ur) for this example, because it is open-source, under active development, and not limited to a specific recommendation scenario.


## Prerequisites

Please follow the instructions in the [./prerequisites](./prerequisites) directory to deploy Universal Recommender and its dependencies on your Kubernetes cluster.
